The HTTP flow section showed exactly what a response body contains. It's just
a text starting with response code and status, followed by headers and in the
end, seperated by an empty line, is the response body (usually HTML).

The Date has to be formatted in a particular way for the browser to display.
Ruby's strftime docs helped me get the format correct.

https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/strftime_formatting_rdoc.html

The format is `Day, day_in_num abv_month_name year_name hour:minutes:seconds
time_zone`
in ruby this is: Time.now.strftime '%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %Z'
